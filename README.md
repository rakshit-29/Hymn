**Hymn is an e-commerce music shopping application developed for android platform.**

**Instructions on how to use the application**
The application can be run on android devices with version KitKat and higher.

The database is stored on google cloud firebase firestore, which is a NoSQL online cloud database.

I have used dependencies in the gradle file for implementing the extensions and files for running firebase on my application.

If you find any difficulties in running the project, please check if your Android Studio settings are according to the build version mentioned.
Also, there might be problems in updating the virtual device manager, so cold boot the device and then run the application or simply remove all cache and rerun the app.


My app basically revolves around fragments, activities, adapters.

Parcelized models are used for creating Cart Items description, User description as well as product description.

I have used my own coded utilities for creating editable text field, buttons, radio button, Bold Text field.

For working with images, I have used GlideLoader package by BumpTech: https://github.com/bumptech/glide.

Here is the logo for my app:
